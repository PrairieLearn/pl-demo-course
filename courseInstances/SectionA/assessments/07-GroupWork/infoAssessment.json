In this configuration, students can create their own groups, with minimum size of 1 and maximum size of 5 (we set minimum of 1 so that anyone can try this assessment on their own, since the assessment can be not started unless the minimum size is reached). PrairieLearn also provides an option were instructors pre-assign students to teams.
