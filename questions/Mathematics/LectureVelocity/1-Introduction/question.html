<p>In Calculus we are often interested in computing how fast a quantity is changing. We may be interested in the average rate of change
  of a function on a given interval, or the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specified point.
  For example, if the function represents the position of a moving object, the instantaneous rate of change is the velocity,
  and can be expressed in units of feet per second, or kilometers per hour.
For a moving object with position function $s(t)$, the average velocity on the interval $t=t_i$ and $t=t_f$ is given by: </p>
$$v_a = \frac{s(t_f) - s(t_i)}{t_f - t_i}$$

<p>Without loss of generality, we can write the average rate of change of a function $f(x)$ in the interval $[a, a+h]$ as:</p>

$$v_a = \frac{f(a+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

</div>

<p> How does the average rate of change of a function is connected to its graph? Take a look at the graph below:</p>

<p> Based on your answers above, how can we relate the average rate of change with a geometric interpretation of the function graph? </p>
