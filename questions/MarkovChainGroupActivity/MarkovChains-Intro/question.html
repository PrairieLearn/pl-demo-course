    The <strong>RECORDER</strong> of this team is the person responsible for completing the notebook for today's activity.
    However, other members of the team can also contribute by completing some of the notebook cells.

    The <strong>MANAGER</strong> of this team should coordinate efforts when other members (that are not the Recorder) want
    to make contribution to the notebook. This will ensure that students are not over-writing each other's code.

      <p>The cells that will be graded are marked with the tag <code>#grade</code>. Do not delete
        that line and/or cell, or the autograder will not be able to find your solution.

      <p> Once you complete each one of the <code>#grade</code> cells, you can click
        "Save & Grade" to see if you got the correct solution. </p>

  <p>To get points for this question, you will need to define the following variables inside the notebook:</p>
  <pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user"></pl-external-grader-variables>

  <p> We encourage you to click "Save & Grade" to check one variable at a time. </p>
